This contains some ImageJ plugins for doing SnapFind-style texture processing.

The work was done in May 2009 and has not been looked at since.
I believe that there were some major bugs in correctness, but with
some time, they should be resolvable. I would not suggest using this
code until it is thoroughly tested and debugged.
